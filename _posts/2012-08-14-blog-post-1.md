I have always wanted to write a book about math. After multiple attempts I have learned a lot from trying to make something which is actually entertaining as well as informative. There are many advantages that a website could have over a book, which I hope to explore. Inspiration for this project comes from Alexander bogomolny's excellent website [cut the knot](https://www.cut-the-knot.org/).
